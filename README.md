An easy way to make platform games for the Playdate console.

This **toybox** depends on **Plupdate**. Make sure you [read about](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/Plupdate#changes-in-your-code) what this means for your code and its `playdate.update()` callback.

‼️ This **toybox** is in active development, the API can change at any time... ‼️
